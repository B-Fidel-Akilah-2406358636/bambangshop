## About this Project
In this repository, we have provided you a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API project using Rocket web framework.

This project consists of four modules:
1.  `controller`: this module contains handler functions used to receive request and send responses.
    In Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, this is the Controller part.
2.  `model`: this module contains structs that serve as data containers.
    In MVC pattern, this is the Model part.
3.  `service`: this module contains structs with business logic methods.
    In MVC pattern, this is also the Model part.
4.  `repository`: this module contains structs that serve as databases and methods to access the databases.
    You can use methods of the struct to get list of objects, or operating an object (create, read, update, delete).

This repository provides a basic functionality that makes BambangShop work: ability to create, read, and delete `Product`s.
This repository already contains a functioning `Product` model, repository, service, and controllers that you can try right away.

As this is an Observer Design Pattern tutorial repository, you need to implement another feature: `Notification`.
This feature will notify creation, promotion, and deletion of a product, to external subscribers that are interested of a certain product type.
The subscribers are another Rocket instances, so the notification will be sent using HTTP POST request to each subscriber's `receive notification` address.

## API Documentations

You can download the Postman Collection JSON here: https://ristek.link/AdvProgWeek7Postman

After you download the Postman Collection, you can try the endpoints inside "BambangShop Publisher" folder.
This Postman collection also contains endpoints that you need to implement later on (the `Notification` feature).

Postman is an installable client that you can use to test web endpoints using HTTP request.
You can also make automated functional testing scripts for REST API projects using this client.
You can install Postman via this website: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## How to Run in Development Environment
1.  Set up environment variables first by creating `.env` file.
    Here is the example of `.env` file:
    ```bash
    APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL="http://localhost:8000"
    ```
    Here are the details of each environment variable:
    | variable              | type   | description                                                |
    |-----------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|
    | APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL | string | URL address where this publisher instance can be accessed. |
2.  Use `cargo run` to run this app.
    (You might want to use `cargo check` if you only need to verify your work without running the app.)

## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Publisher) Reflections

#### Reflection Publisher-1
Struct vs. Trait: A struct is enough for now. All subscribers currently behave the same way (receiving a JSON via URL). You only need a Trait if you later add different types of subscribers—like Email or Discord—that require unique delivery logic.

Vec vs. DashMap: DashMap is necessary. It provides O(1) lookup speed. Using a Vec would require looping through the entire list (O(n)) to check for uniqueness or to delete a specific URL, which is inefficient.

Singleton vs. DashMap: We still need DashMap. The Singleton pattern only ensures there is a single instance of the database. It does not handle "traffic control." DashMap provides the thread-safety (concurrency) Rust requires to let multiple threads access that one instance without crashing.
#### Reflection Publisher-2
Service and Repository separation: Separating them follows the Single Responsibility Principle. Repository only handles data access (CRUD operations), while Service only handles business logic. If we keep everything in the Model, each Model class would be doing too many things at once, making it harder to maintain and test.

Without separation: If we only use the Model, each model (Product, Subscriber, Notification) would contain its own data storage logic, business rules, and interactions with other models all in one place. Product would need to know how to fetch Subscribers and send Notifications directly. Subscriber would need to know about Products it subscribes to and how Notifications are structured. This creates tight coupling between models and makes the code much more complex, harder to read, and difficult to modify without breaking other parts.

Postman: Postman is very helpful for testing the REST API endpoints without needing a frontend. I can send POST requests to subscribe/unsubscribe and verify the responses. Features I find useful include Collections (to organize and save related requests), Environment Variables (to switch between dev/prod URLs easily), and Automated Testing (to write test scripts that validate response status codes and body content). These would be helpful for group projects to ensure API reliability.
